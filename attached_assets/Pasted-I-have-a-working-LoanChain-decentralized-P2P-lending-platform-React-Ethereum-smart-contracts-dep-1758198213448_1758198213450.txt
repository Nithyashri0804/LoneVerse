I have a working LoanChain decentralized P2P lending platform (React + Ethereum smart contracts) deployed on Sepolia testnet. I want to enhance it with modern DeFi features, better UX, and advanced functionality.

Current State:

✅ Basic loan requests and funding working
✅ Smart contracts deployed on Sepolia
✅ Frontend connected to MetaMask
✅ Backend API with ML risk assessment
Implementation Priority: Please implement these in phases, completing each phase before moving to the next.

Phase 1: Core UX Improvements (High Priority)
Enhanced Loan Discovery & Filtering

Add advanced filtering (amount range, interest rate, duration, borrower reputation)
Implement search functionality for loan marketplace
Add sorting options (newest, lowest rate, highest amount, risk level)
Create a dedicated "Browse Loans" page with grid/list view toggle
Real-time Notifications System

Email notifications for loan events (funded, due date reminders, repaid)
In-app notification center with badge counters
Browser push notifications for critical events
SMS notifications via Twilio integration
Analytics Dashboard Enhancement

Add interactive charts for portfolio performance
Create loan analytics (total volume, success rates, average interest)
Implement historical data tracking and trends
Add earnings calculator and projections
User Reputation & Trust System

Track and display borrower repayment history
Create credit scores based on on-chain behavior
Add verification badges for trusted users
Implement lender rating system
Phase 2: DeFi Features (Medium Priority)
Multi-Token Support

Add USDC, DAI, USDT lending support
Implement token price oracles (Chainlink)
Enable cross-collateral (ETH collateral for stablecoin loans)
Create token swap functionality
Advanced Loan Features

Partial loan funding (multiple lenders per loan)
Variable interest rate loans
Loan pools and automated matching
Insurance options for lenders
Yield & Staking Features

Auto-reinvestment of earned interest
Create platform governance token with staking rewards
Implement liquidity mining incentives
Add compound interest calculations
Phase 3: Platform Scaling (Lower Priority)
Mobile & Accessibility

Make fully responsive for mobile devices
Add PWA capabilities (installable web app)
Implement Web3 wallet integrations (WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
Add multi-language support
Cross-Chain & Integration

Deploy to Polygon and Arbitrum networks
Add cross-chain bridge functionality
Integrate with other DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave)
Create API for third-party integrations
Technical Requirements:

Maintain existing codebase structure and security standards
Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
Implement proper error handling and loading states
Add comprehensive testing for new features
Ensure mobile responsiveness
Optimize for gas efficiency on smart contracts
Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive data
Design Preferences:

Keep the current dark theme and modern UI
Use consistent color scheme (blue primary, green for positive actions)
Maintain clean, professional DeFi aesthetic
Add smooth animations and transitions
Ensure accessibility compliance
Success Criteria:

All features work seamlessly with existing functionality
No breaking changes to current user flows
Improved user engagement and retention
Better loan discovery and matching
Enhanced trust and safety for users
Please implement Phase 1 first, test thoroughly, then ask for approval before proceeding to Phase 2.
