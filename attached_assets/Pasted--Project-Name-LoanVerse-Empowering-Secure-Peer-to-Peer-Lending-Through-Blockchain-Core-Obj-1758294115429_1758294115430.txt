
**Project Name:** LoanVerse: Empowering Secure Peer-to-Peer Lending Through Blockchain
**Core Objective:** To develop a decentralized loan management system (DApp) that eliminates intermediaries, ensures transparency via blockchain, and automates the loan lifecycle using smart contracts.
**Key Principles & System Architecture (For AI Context):**

1.  **Foundational Model:** Our system is a **peer-to-peer lending protocol** built on **over-collateralization**. Users borrow stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI) by locking up cryptocurrency collateral (e.g., ETH, WBTC) worth more than the loan value. This is the primary security mechanism.

2.  **The "Why Borrow?" Principle:** A core user education point. Borrowers use this system to access liquidity *without selling* their appreciating crypto assets, for tax efficiency, and for leverage. The system must reflect this value proposition.

3.  **Core Components (Your Objectives as Features):**
    *   **Smart Contract Automation:** The entire loan lifecycle (initiation, disbursement, repayment, default) must be automated via Ethereum smart contracts.
    *   **Dynamic Interest Rates & Algorithmic Matching:** Implement a mechanism for borrowers and lenders to be matched based on offered/requested interest rates and loan terms.
    *   **IPFS Integration:** All loan agreements and collateral documentation must be hashed and stored on IPFS, with the hash recorded immutably on-chain.
    *   **Risk Assessment & On-Chain Credit Scoring:** Develop a logic to evaluate borrower risk based on collateralization ratio, loan history, and repayment behavior. Maintain an on-chain credit score for users.
    *   **Default Handling & Collateral Liquidation:** The most critical function. Smart contracts must automatically liquidate collateral via a secure auction or oracle-driven process if the collateral value falls below a predefined threshold.
    *   **Multi-Token Support:** The system should be designed to handle multiple ERC-20 tokens for both collateral and loans.

4.  **Target Applications (Our Use Cases):**
    *   P2P Lending Platforms
    *   Crypto-Backed Loans
    *   Microfinance
    *   Student Loans (with reputation scoring)

**Directives for AI Agent Assistance:**

Your role is to assist in the design and development of the above system. Please align all your outputs with the stated tech stack and principles. Your tasks include:

*   **Smart Contract Development:**
    *   Review and suggest optimizations for Solidity code for core functions: `requestLoan()`, `provideLoan()`, `repayLoan()`, `liquidateCollateral()`.
    *   Help design the contract architecture for `LoanFactory.sol`, `LoanContract.sol`, and a `CreditScore.sol` library.
    *   Advise on secure oracle integration (e.g., Chainlink) for accurate price feeds for collateral valuation and liquidation triggers.
    *   Ensure code follows best practices (e.g., CEI, reentrancy guards, use of OpenZeppelin libraries).

*   **System Design & Architecture:**
    *   Help draft sequence diagrams for key user flows: Loan Application, Funding, Repayment, Liquidation.
    *   Suggest a data model for on-chain and off-chain (IPFS) storage.
    *   Plan the interaction between the frontend, smart contracts, and IPFS.

*   **Risk & Security Analysis:**
    *   Identify potential vulnerabilities in the economic model (e.g., flash loan attacks on liquidation) and smart contract code.
    *   Propose mitigation strategies for these risks.

*   **User Experience (UX) & Frontend:**
    *   Help formulate user stories for Personas: The Borrower, The Lender, The Liquidator.
    *   Draft clear UI/UX copy that explains complex concepts like over-collateralization, liquidation risk, and credit scores to users.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   Assist in generating technical documentation and inline NatSpec comments for the smart contracts.

**Goal:** To create a secure, transparent, and fully functional prototype of the LoanVerse DApp that demonstrates the automated, trustless loan lifecycle as described in our synopsis.
