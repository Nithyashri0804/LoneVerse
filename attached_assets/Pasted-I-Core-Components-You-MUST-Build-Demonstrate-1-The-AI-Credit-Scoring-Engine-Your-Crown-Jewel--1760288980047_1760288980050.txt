I. Core Components You MUST Build & Demonstrate
1. The AI Credit Scoring Engine (Your Crown Jewel)
What you need:

A working Python script/model that takes a wallet address and returns a credit score (300-850)

It must implement your weighted algorithm with real metrics:

Transaction Analysis (30%): Tx count, volume, frequency, time between transactions

Portfolio Stability (25%): Stablecoin ratio, holding period diversity, volatility metrics

Lending History (25%): Previous loan repayment data (you'll need to simulate this)

DeFi Behavior (20%): Protocol interactions, yield farming patterns, smart contract calls

How to represent it in paper:

python
# ACTUAL CODE YOU SHOULD IMPLEMENT
def calculate_credit_score(wallet_address):
    # Real implementation with actual on-chain data queries
    tx_score = analyze_transaction_metrics(wallet_address)
    portfolio_score = analyze_holdings_diversity(wallet_address) 
    history_score = check_loan_history(wallet_address)  # From your testnet
    behavior_score = analyze_defi_engagement(wallet_address)
    
    return weighted_score  # Real number between 300-850
2. Deployed Smart Contracts on Testnet
What you need:

LendingPool.sol - Actually deployed and verified on Sepolia/Polygon Mumbai

RiskEngine.sol - With functioning calculateCreditScore() that integrates with your AI model

CollateralManager.sol - With real Chainlink price feed integration

All contracts must have:

Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

Gas optimization metrics

Security analysis (Slither report)

3. Working Frontend DApp
What you need:

React.js interface that connects to your deployed contracts

Functional loan request flow with real credit scoring

Live collateral requirement calculator

AI chatbot integration (can use GPT-4 API with custom prompts)

How to represent it:

Screenshots/Videos of complete user journey

Demo link for reviewers to test

Mobile responsiveness proof

4. Experimental Data & Results
What you need:

Dataset of 1000+ wallet addresses with historical data

Performance metrics comparing your system vs benchmarks

Statistical validation of your credit scoring model

give me the right promt i can give replit to check the project i put on git has all the above requirements
